            Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first
            successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in
            mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped
            foster the Web's subsequent explosive development. He is the founder and director of the World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith)
            the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
            Sciences.
